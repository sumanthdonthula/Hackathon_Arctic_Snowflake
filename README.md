and copy script from Streamlit Files->streamlit_app.py and save the app.

Step-5:
Place, pandata-logo.PNG from Streamlit Files->pandata-logo.PNG into the folder where staging for streamlit_app is there. Data->HACKATHON.PUBLIC -> Stages -> "Stage Created for Streamlit App"-> pandata-logo.PNG

Step-6:
Copy Streamlit Files->environment.yml file into the folder where staging for streamlit_app is there. Data->HACKATHON.PUBLIC -> Stages -> "Stage Created for Streamlit App"-> environment.yml
